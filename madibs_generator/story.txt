Today I went to the <place> with my best friend <person>. We decided to try the <adjective> new <activity> that everyone was talking about. First, we had to wear <plural_noun>, which made us look really <adjective>. After a few minutes, <person> accidentally <verb_past_tense> and everyone started <verb_ending_in_ing>. It was the most <adjective> day ever, and we can't wait to go back next <day_of_week>!
